    <h1>GREGGY 2020</h1>
    <p align = justify>
        Dear American People,
        <br/>
        <br/>
            You have a choice before you, its a fundamental decision. Do you want free and debt free
            college education? Do you want to have a progressive economic agenda that creates job,
            raises wages, protects the environment and provides healthcare for all? Do you want to
            be a part of an open world with fair and morally sound immigration? If you answered yes, 
            we together could be well on our way to solving the most important issues of our time which 
            will determine the future of our homeland.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        Sincerely,
        <br/>
        Greggy
    <br/>

        Stance on the Issue
    </h2>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Free and Debt Free Education</b></dt>
            <dd align = justify>
                - This idea isnt a radical one. The Greggy Promise will ensure America will follow 
                the example of Germany, Chile, Norway and Finland and offer free college education
                in public universities throughout the nation. 
            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
                - It is my promise to you, to stop the federal government from making profit off student
                loans. It has been a long overdue morally wrong process that has to end. 
            </dd> 
            <dd align = justify>
                - Americans should be allowed access to low interest rate student loans which can be cleared
                 by work-study plans or wont need to be paid until full time employment status after graduation.
            </dd>
        <dt><b>Creating Jobs and Improving Wages for Everyone</b></dt>
            <dd align = justify>
                - Our country need a development and improvement strategy for our poorly maintained 
                roads and bridges. The 'Better America Act' would double the current funding for highway 
                and transit development and would bring in private capital to ease the strain on taxpayers
                money.
            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
                - The Rail network is obsolete and we have to move towards high speed rail like in countries 
                like China and Switzerland. The 'Better America Act' will focus on converting our existing rail to
                energy efficent and high speed rail lines to move around people and goods more effectively.
            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
                - Our dams are deficient and the main goal of 'Better America Act' would be to imrpove our damns
                to better handle floods and emergency situations while providing work to many.
            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
                - With the evergrowing need to compute and access information, the boardband speeds in our country needs
                to be improved to cope. The 'Better America Act' will invest $5 billion to provide the neccesity
                of the 21st century. 
            </dd>
        <dt><b>Healthcare for All</b></dt>
            <dd align = justify>
                - 'HealthAll' is an important Act under the Greggy Promise. With this act, Greggy hopes to abolish copay, deductibles
                and need to talk to healcare companies and negotiate payment of charges.

                - The Greggy promise hopes to ensure a continuous supply of medicine to even the most remotely located communities
                and implement a centralised cost efficent automatic prescription filling service.

            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
                -Its high time we treated our immigrants with respect and dismantled deportation programs and
                private detention centers.
            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
                - Its the 21st century and our <b>BORDERS DONT NEED WALLS</b>. Legalisation can happen without the security of our walls.
            </dd>
            <dd align = justify>
